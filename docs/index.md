* Group 1:
    * Accounting: The process of recording, summarizing, and analyzing financial transactions to provide an accurate picture of a company’s financial health.
    * Taxes: Mandatory financial charges imposed by the government on income, profits, or other transactions, used to fund public services and infrastructure.
    * Assets: Resources owned by an individual or company that have value and can be used to generate income or provide future benefits (e.g., cash, property, equipment).
    * Liability: Financial obligations or debts owed by an individual or company to other parties (e.g., loans, accounts payable).
    * Balance Sheets: Financial statements that provide a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time, showing what the company owns and owes.
    * Equity: The ownership value in an asset or company, calculated as assets minus liabilities; for companies, it represents shareholders' ownership in the firm.
    * Stocks: Shares representing ownership in a company. Stockholders can benefit from dividends and potential appreciation in stock value.
    * Bonds: Debt securities issued by corporations or governments that pay periodic interest and return the principal amount at maturity.
    * Stock Markets and Bond Markets: Stock markets are platforms where stocks are bought and sold. Bond markets are where bonds are traded. Both are essential for raising capital and investment.
    * Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks, which hold a collection of assets like stocks or bonds and offer diversification.
    * Market Capitalization: The total value of a company’s outstanding shares of stock, calculated by multiplying the stock price by the number of shares.
    * HoDL: A misspelling of "HODL," which stands for "Hold On for Dear Life," a term used in cryptocurrency communities to refer to holding onto assets despite market fluctuations.
    * Market Timing: The strategy of making investment decisions based on predicting market movements, such as buying low and selling high, often aiming to maximize returns by timing entry and exit points.
    * Corporation: A legal entity that is separate from its owners, with its own rights and responsibilities. It can enter into contracts, own assets, incur liabilities, and is subject to its own regulations. Corporations are typically owned by shareholders, who elect a board of directors to oversee management and operations.
* Group 2:
    * Financial Advisor: Imagine you're playing a really cool strategy game, and there's this super-smart friend who always gives you tips on the best moves to make. A financial advisor is like that friend, but for money! They help you decide how to use your money to reach your goals, like saving up for something awesome.
    * Risk: Risk is like taking a chance in a game. Sometimes, you might win big, and sometimes you might lose. In money terms, risk means there’s a chance you could lose money on an investment, but there's also a chance you could earn more!
    * Asset Allocation: Think of your money like a pizza. Asset allocation is deciding how to slice up that pizza into different flavors. You might want to put some slices in stocks (which can be spicy!) and some in bonds (which are more like cheese—steady and safe). It’s about spreading your money around to balance risk and reward.
    * Portfolio: A portfolio is like your collection of favorite things—like a playlist of your top songs or a collection of trading cards. In money terms, it’s a collection of all the different investments you own, like stocks, bonds, and more.
    * Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are like a team-up in a video game. Lots of people put their money together to buy a bunch of different investments, like a team working together to win a big battle. Everyone in the team shares the gains and losses.
    * Divdends: Dividends are like bonus points! When you own a piece of a company (a stock), the company might share some of its profits with you as a reward. That’s called a dividend, and it’s like getting extra money just for being a part-owner of the company
    * Common Stock: Owning common stock is like having a ticket to a really cool concert. You get to be part of the show (the company) and even have a say in what happens (like voting on big decisions). But sometimes, the show might not be perfect, and your ticket might lose value.
    * Preferred Stock: Preferred stock is like a VIP pass at that same concert. You might not get to vote on what songs are played, but you get special treatment, like getting your money back first if things go wrong.
    * Stock Ticker / Ticker Symbol: A stock ticker is like a secret code or nickname for a company in the stock market. It’s usually just a few letters, like “AAPL” for Apple. It helps people quickly know which company’s stock they’re talking about.
    * Inflation / Deflation: Inflation is like when everything in your favorite snack shop gets more expensive—so your money doesn’t buy as much as it used to. Deflation is the opposite; it’s like when everything goes on sale, and your money buys more than before.
    * Stock Quote: A stock quote is like checking the score of a game. It tells you the latest price of a company’s stock, so you know if it’s going up (winning) or down (losing).
    * GDP: GDP is like the report card for a whole country. It measures how much stuff (goods and services) the country is making and selling. A high GDP means the country is doing well, like getting an A+.
    * Trading Volume: Trading volume is like counting how many times a toy is traded at school. It tells you how many shares of a stock are being bought and sold. If a lot of people are trading, the volume is high, like a busy trading day on the playground.
    * Trading Volume: Trading volume is like keeping track of how many times something is exchanged in a busy marketplace. In the stock market, it measures how many shares of a particular stock are bought or sold in a specific period, like a day. High trading volume means a lot of people are interested in that stock, while low volume might mean fewer people are trading it. It’s a good indicator of how active and popular a stock is at any given time.

# The Smartest Thing I've Heard This Decade

* Prof. Scott Galloway, "Pivot" podcast, Jan 23, 2024:  repeating what he's said several times before:

"Where would I invest?"
It's dangerous to listen to people like me & talking heads on podcasts make stock recommendations.
And I like it, and it's fun, and I tell people, "Take 1/3rd of your money and put it in stocks, because A) you'll learn about the markets, and it's kinda fun - you'll feel good about yourself when it goes up,
and beat yourself up when it goes down.  But for the most part, what you want to do, if this market has taught us anything: don't try to pick the needle in the haystack -- PICK THE WHOLE HAYSTACK!
Buy the whole market. Unless you're a genius, and maybe you didn't have to be a genius, people talk about their wins and don't talk about their losses,
7 stocks were responsible for 70% of the gains last year!
You think you're smart enough to pick the 7 of the 500? So, instead, just buy the 500 and what do you know, what were you up, in the teens last year?
If you do that - if you compound, going into your primary earning years, what the market has done for the last 11 years, it means every 7 years you're doubling your money. Just from an emotional and mental wellbeing,
this is what you want to do. You want to focus all of your mental, physical, and emotional energy on your day job, and you want to turn your investing over to an outstanding professional that is really good at what
they do, but at the same time, it's really inexpensive and that's called an index fund & ETF fund.
Eg, You're not good at building your own home.  What if you could find someone to build your home that was outstanding at building homes, and was really cheap - that's called an index or ETF fund
Don't buy a stock - buy the market.  And the temptation to believe that you're smarter than everybody and all of these "financial-industrial complex" will teach you that this old-looking guy, all
these quant-people with Ph.D's have some sort of special insight, or they're investing in ESG... whatever the branding is, they're ripping you off!
My recommendation on where to invest, is just start invensting, and invest in index or ETF funds.
AS DO I - the S&P!
